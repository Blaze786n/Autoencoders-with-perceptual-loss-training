# Autoencoders-Personal Reasearch Project
Designed a deep learning-based image transmission framework using autoencoders with perceptual loss, attention modules, and entropy coding. Achieved 11% higher SSIM (0.91) and 35â€“40% better compression via latent quantization and adaptive bitrate control. Built real-time socket-based transfer pipeline using PyTorch and Python.
